## Project

This works include for wide known dataset Wine-Quality dataset. 
Basically, dataset include two wine samples which is red and white. 
Each dataset include 11 independent features which are "fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";
"citric acid";"residual sugar"; "chlorides"; "free sulfur dioxide"; "total sulfur dioxide";
"density"; "pH"; "sulphates"; "alcohol";  and one dependent feature that is "quality" and
specify wine quality. In this report we emphasize on data statics info such as Fisher distances, 
standart data distribution boxplots etc. and analysis each dataset with feature dimention 
reduction techniques such as principle component analysis(PCA) and self
orginizing maps (SOM) and on the other hand analysis each dataset and 
compare their results with unsupervised learning algorithms which are 
K-Means, K-Center, DBSCAN and Farthest-First
